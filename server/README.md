# Server Side of the TART

The worldwide network of TART telescopes are all available directly, but also available through a common web interface at http://tart.elec.ac.nz/<tart_name>, where <tart_name> is the unique name of each TART. How this is done is described here.


## Service Discovery

Each TART telescope runs a service that connects it to a VPN network hosted in the cloud.
